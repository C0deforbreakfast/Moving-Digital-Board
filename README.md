    A sequential logic circuit scarcely simulating a digital moving board.

* Components used in the project:
  - Drawing board (using switches for indicating each pixels)
  - Synchronous universal shift registers
  - D-flip flops
  - Multiplexers
  - Digital board (using probes for displaying indicated character)
